1 Conquer the anger and ravenous rage!
2 Make it a part of your power
3 Pummeling down let your bloodlust engage!
4 Under your force they will cower
5 Feeling the fury so pure and so bright
6 Breaking the bonds of surrender
7 Under the moon for our home we will fight
8 And we will die to defend her
9 And my voice is my violence
10 Clear the sky's frozen tears
11 And no more we'll be silent
12 With this Sovngarde song in our ears
